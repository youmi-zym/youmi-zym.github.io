## Rock Universe

Welcome to our Rock Universe, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hi_rockuniverse) and [GitHub](https://github.com/rockuniverse-tech)!

## Brief Bio

I received my Ph.D. degress at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) in 2024, under the co-supervision of [Prof.Stefano Mattoccia](http://vision.deis.unibo.it/~smatt/Site/Home.html) and [Prof.Matteo Poggi](https://mattpoggi.github.io/).

I'm also working with [Fabio Tosi](https://fabiotosi92.github.io/), [Filippo Aleotti](https://filippoaleotti.github.io/website/), [Erik Sandstr√∂m](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=phiETm4AAAAJ&hl=en).

<!--span style="color:red">I am on track to complete my PhD in February 2024. I'm actively looking for a research position.</span-->
